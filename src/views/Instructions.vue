					<h2>How to play</h2>
					<p>You will each be assigned a role of Human, Wolf, or Reaper.</p>
					<p>
						There are a maximum of one Wolf and one Reaper each game, everyone
						else is a Human.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each Human is given a secret word, and must try to describe to the
						other players without saying or exposing their word.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Wolf thinks they are Human, and without knowing, are given a
						different secret word to the Humans. They will work to describe
						their word, thinking they have the same word as everyone else.
					</p>
					<p>
						Reapers donâ€™t get a word, and instead must pretend they have the
						same word as everyone else.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each round, you will all take turns to describe the word you have.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are the Reaper, you must try to describe the word you think
						everyone else has. <br />
						If you can guess the word that the Humans have,
						<strong> you will eliminate everyone at once</strong>, winning the
						game.
					</p>
					<p>
						Humans or Wolves win the game by surviving being caught by the
						Reaper, or by being voted out of the game.
