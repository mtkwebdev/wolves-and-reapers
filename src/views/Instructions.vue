						Try to escape by eliminating the Reaper and Werewolf before they

						<strong>Humans:</strong> Survive being caught by the Wolf or Reaper.

					<p class="instruction-text">
						<strong>Wolf:</strong> Avoid being caught by the Reaper or found out

					<h2 class="instruction-heading">How to play</h2>
					<p class="instruction-text">
						You will each be assigned a role of Human, Wolf, or Reaper.
					</p>
					<p class="instruction-text">
						There are a maximum of one Wolf and one Reaper each game, everyone
						else is a Human.
					</p>
					<p class="instruction-text">
						Each Human is given a secret word, and must try to describe to the
						other players without saying or exposing their word.
					</p>
					<p class="instruction-text">
						The Wolf thinks they are Human, and without knowing, are given a
						different secret word to the Humans. They will work to describe
						their word, thinking they have the same word as everyone else.
					</p>
					<p class="instruction-text">
						Reapers donâ€™t get a word, and instead must pretend they have the
						same word as everyone else.
					</p>
					<p class="instruction-text">
						Each round, you will all take turns to describe the word you have.
					</p>
					<p class="instruction-text">
						If you are the Reaper, you must try to describe the word you think
						everyone else has. <br />
						If you can guess the word that the Humans have,
						<strong> you will eliminate everyone at once</strong>, winning the
						game.
					</p>
					<p class="instruction-text">
						Humans or Wolves win the game by surviving being caught by the
						Reaper, or by being voted out of the game.
